# NATS Date & Time Hub

This Python script connects to a NATS server and listens for specific commands to retrieve the current date and time. When it receives a request, it responds with the current date and time in a JSON format.

## Overview

The script listens to the NATS subject `concentrateur.dateheure.get`. When it receives a message with the correct format and command, it responds with the current date and time.

### Features

- **NATS Connection**: Connects to a NATS server using a specified IP address, port, username, and password.
- **JSON Parsing**: Converts incoming messages to JSON format to detect specific commands.
- **Date & Time Response**: Returns the current date and time in a specified format when the appropriate command is received.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nats-date-time-hub.git
   cd nats-date-time-hub
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and `pip` installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install nats-py
   ```

3. **Configure NATS Server**:
   Edit the `main()` function in the script to replace `machineIpAdresse` and `Port` with the appropriate values for your NATS server. Also, ensure that the username and password are correct.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   Simply execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 your_script_name.py
   ```

2. **Listening to NATS**:
   The script will start listening to the `concentrateur.dateheure.get` subject for incoming messages. When it receives a message with the `"type": "TELECOMMANDE"` and `"action": "GET_DATE&HEURE"`, it will respond with the current date and time.

3. **Example Message**:
   Here's an example of a message the script listens for:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "TELECOMMANDE",
     "action": "GET_DATE&HEURE"
   }
   ```

   And the response format will be:
   ```json
   {
     "dateCourante": "27/08/2024",
     "heureCourante": "14:35:00"
   }
   ```
